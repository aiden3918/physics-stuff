# Nonnegligible

## A simple simulation of a (spherical only, for now) object through different mediums
 
### Disclaimers
	- Takes place on Earth (g ~ 9.8 m/s^2)
	- Assumes singe-direction, equally divided laminar flow with a rigid body
	- Does not take into account aerodynamics nor rotational forces (yet!)
	- Very simple, and frankly, not that precise

### Features
	- 3 mediums: vacuum, air (STP), water (STP)
	- full, real-time object specs (updates every frame)
	- more FPS = greater accuracy
	- simulate sphere with customizable attributes
